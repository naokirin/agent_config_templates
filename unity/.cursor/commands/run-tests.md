# Run Tests and Fix Failures

Run the Unity test suite and fix any failures using the **unity-tester** agent.

If the user specified files or directories, run tests for that scope and prioritize fixing failures there. Prefer Edit Mode tests when possible for speed; use Play Mode when the test requires runtime/GameObject behavior.
