# Unity / C# Project

## Principles

- **Unity Conventions**: Follow [Unity C# coding conventions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/coding-conventions.html) for naming, layout, and API usage. Place scripts under `Assets/Scripts/`; use Assembly Definition (.asmdef) when splitting assemblies.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer components and composition; avoid deep MonoBehaviour inheritance. Use ScriptableObjects for data and settings.
- **Editor and Runtime Separation**: Keep Editor-only code in `Editor/` folders; avoid runtime logic depending on editor APIs.

## Standard Directory Layout

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Assets/Scripts/` | Runtime C# scripts |
| `Assets/Scripts/Editor/` | Editor scripts, custom inspectors |
| `Assets/Tests/` | Unity Test Framework tests |
| `Assets/Resources/` | Runtime-loadable assets (use sparingly) |
| `Packages/` | Package manifests and embedded packages |
| `ProjectSettings/` | Unity project settings |

## Style and Verification

- **C# Style**: Follow csharp-style and unity-scripts rules. Use PascalCase for public and [SerializeField] members; camelCase for private fields.
- **Format**: Use `dotnet format` when project has SDK-style .csproj; otherwise follow EditorConfig/project conventions.
- **Tests**: Use Unity Test Framework (NUnit). Run tests after code changes to confirm no regressions.
- **Verification**: After code changes, ensure project compiles and run relevant tests. Use `/run-tests` and `/run-format` when available.

## Planning (Cursor)

For large or multi-file changes, use Plan Mode to create an implementation plan and get approval before coding.
