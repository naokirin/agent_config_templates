# Code Review (Unity / C#)

Review Unity and C# code for style, conventions, performance, and maintainability using the **unity-code-reviewer** agent.

Focus on: C# style (naming, null handling, async); Unity usage (MonoBehaviour lifecycle, SerializeField, GetComponent caching); assembly boundaries; test coverage; and common pitfalls (allocations in Update, Resources.Load abuse).
