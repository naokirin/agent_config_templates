# Review Rust Code

Review Rust code for style, idioms, safety, and maintainability using the **rust-code-reviewer** agent.

Provide the code or scope to review (e.g. open files, recent git diff, or path). The agent will use the project rules (rust-core, rust-style, rust-idioms, rust-anti-patterns) and report Critical / Warning / Suggestion with concrete fixes where helpful.
