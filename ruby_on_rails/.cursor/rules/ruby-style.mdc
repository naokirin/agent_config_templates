# Ruby Style

- Use two spaces for indentation. Limit line length to 80 characters (up to 120 with team agreement).
- One blank line between methods and classes. No blank line after `end`.
- Space around operators. Space after `{` and before `}` in hash literals.
- Do not terminate statements with `;`. One expression per line.
- Method names: `snake_case`. Classes/modules: `CamelCase`. Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Use `:symbol` for symbols. Prefer `key: value` style for hash keys when using symbols.
- Prefer single-quoted strings; use double quotes only when interpolation or `\` is needed.
- Use `&&` / `||` instead of `and` / `or`. No space after `!`.
- Avoid long `&.` chains; consider delegation or explicit nil checks.
